          I have completed various coding projects, not only in school and work, but also in my personal life. This includes my Oxygen Monitor project for the Texas A&M University Department of Chemistry Helium Recovery Facility, my personal Website (https://caderoyal.com), and various coding projects that I have done during my time at Texas A&M.
